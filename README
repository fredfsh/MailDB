==================
Configuration
==================
0. Run an instance of Redis on each of your data server. Redis is an open
  source project available at http://redis.io/download
1. Put hostnames or ips of your Redis servers in config file RedisServers.cfg,
  one per line. With no help of consistent hashing, the virtual config server
  just replicates all the data on every Redis server.
2. Available apis are defined in api.h, you can invoke them in the source
  code file of your own client client.c.
3. Some configurable parameters are placed in def.h, as well as other header
  files.
